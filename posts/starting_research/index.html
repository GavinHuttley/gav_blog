<h1>So you‚Äôre starting a research project, where do you begin?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-you-re-starting-a-research-project-where-do-you-begin" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h1>
<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>This post is intended for anyone starting out in research and development with a computational bent whether in a science (e.g. computational biology) or engineering context. In particular, I‚Äôm focussed on the research process that leads to new tools and analysis methods.</p>
<p>Up until this point, your exposure to the knowledge discovery process has likely been limited to descriptions in textbooks of how ‚Äúa thing‚Äù was discovered and by whom. While being a consumer of such knowledge discovery is often challenging, the account you read is a highly distilled version of what actually happened. Being the original discoverer is clearly more difficult.</p>
<p>Take heart! Discoveries are not arrived at in completed form. By employing a systematic approach we incrementally assemble the pieces that allow us to draw that new insight and develop something new and valuable. What follows is a sketch of my process.</p>
</section>
<section id="structure-is-key">
<h2>Structure is key<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-is-key" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>I break the process into 3 questions you must answer: <em>Why</em>, <em>What</em> and <em>How</em>. These correspond to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Why</em> is there a problem?</p></li>
<li><p><em>What</em> is the problem?</p></li>
<li><p><em>How</em>  will you solve it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But before we delve into those, you need to answer two other questions. What form does your final output need to be? When is that due??? If you perform research and make a brilliant discovery but don‚Äôt write a systematic description of how you made that discovery, it is the same as not doing anything. Establish what form your <strong>final</strong> output should be in (talk to your supervisor). Your project plan should be something that directly references that and makes delivering it easy.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-why">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>The Why<a class="headerlink" href="#the-why" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>Why does the problem even exist? Why is it a problem worthy of your attention? Why hasn‚Äôt it already been solved? Answering all these is your justification for doing the work and, at the very least, should make you comfortable you may be doing something worthwhile.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is really the big picture part of the project and should proceed everything else. Being able to identify the existence of a problem requires you have a solid understanding of the domain. At this stage in your career, it‚Äôs quite likely that you have been ‚Äúgiven‚Äù the problem. But once you take it, it becomes <strong>your</strong> problem <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id11" id="id2">1</a>. Ultimately, this requires reading about what others have done.</p>
<section id="what-are-the-existing-solutions-and-why-are-those-inadequate">
<h3>What are the existing solutions and why are those inadequate?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-existing-solutions-and-why-are-those-inadequate" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h3>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>When you examine existing solutions, take a big picture view. What are the core algorithms they implement? How do the algorithms relate to each other? What are their inputs and outputs? Do they have a killer flaw or are they blocking a key opportunity?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Establishing <a class="reference internal" href="#the-why"><span class="std std-ref">The Why</span></a> almost always requires in depth of consideration of what others have already done. So what are the existing solutions and why are they not good enough? Study them carefully to look for a new avenue of investigation and to frame your response to <a class="reference internal" href="#the-what"><span class="std std-ref">The What</span></a>. Pay particular attention to the way in which prior work was done as that defines a minimum standard you must meet to have your own work taken seriously.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Criticising the work of others is ‚Äúcore business‚Äù in science and engineering. That said, consider these three very important qualifiers when you frame that criticism.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>What is <strong>the evidence</strong> the solutions are inadequate? (That evidence can be measurement, or a theoretical property.)</p></li>
<li><p>The prior work was likely developed against different technological inputs <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id12" id="id3">2</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Much of the information available to us now may not not have been available to the authors of the original work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A critique of the work of others is based on what we know now. So be respectful. I guarantee you that someone in the future will be casting their critical eye over what you do.</p>

This statement may need to be updated as your knowledge of the domain increases <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id13" id="id5">3</a>. Critically, the statement must be something you can actually solve!</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the nitty gritty and why you‚Äôre reading this. It is your statement of what YOU will achieve and stems from the careful consideration described above. The framing of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù problem you will solve can benefit from identifying both its inputs and outputs. By this I mean, what is the input data? This includes where the data will (or can) come from. What is the output you will produce?</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Together, the inputs and outputs define your target audience.</p>

<div><p>What is the value <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id14" id="id6">4</a> of your proposed solution? To establish this value, be clear on the output of your work and why it will be more valuable than what exists. Will it improve prediction accuracy? Will it require a magnitudes less computing resources? Will it be more maintainable?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Your answer here should reflect the significance you have attributed to the shortcomings of existing approaches and your argument of the benefit to the target audience.</p>
<p>But that thinking is contingent upon the successful completion of the project. The value of a project also comes from what can be learned <em>if it fails</em>. You must prepare yourself for possibility that your proposal will not deliver on this promised value. So here‚Äôs a crucial reality-check ‚Äì is a negative answer still interesting?</p>
<p>At the very least, you do not want the project to fail because you did not ensure the <a class="reference internal" href="#correctness"><span class="std std-ref">correctness</span></a> of your implementation or execution.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs your process, go over the list of issues above, then draft a flowchart. The flow chart nodes are ‚Äúprocesses‚Äù in your research project (e.g. data sampling). The flow chart will be a dynamic figure, meaning that you will update and refine it as you go.

<p>If you can break a project into components, what is the dependency structure among them? Put the most difficult ones as close to the beginning of a project execution plan as possible.</p>
<p>It requires some significant mental effort to see how you can break a problem down into parts that can be solved independently. Having done that, which is most central to your goal? Tackling that must be a priority.</p>

<p>Too often, junior researchers / engineers think they need to solve the entirety of a project by themselves. Nope!</p>
<p>Science and engineering deliver consistently better results when multiple brains are involved. Discussions with others help you develop your understanding and also provide crucial perspective that can help you decide when you may be wasting your time pursuing an approach that cannot work or when a superior approach is possible. Your supervisor provides a crucial point of contact for such discussions. In my view, however, they should not be the only person you discuss things with.</p>

<p>A key skill is knowing what <em>you</em> don‚Äôt know and being able to identify someone else with the necessary knowledge. That said, another key skill is trying to solve a problem yourself before you ask someone else for help. If you find yourself in the position of wanting to get help, ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<li><p>Have you seriously tried?</p></li>
<li><p>What steps have you taken which you can show to the person you‚Äôre about to ask?</p></li>
