<h1>So you’re starting a research project, where do you begin?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-you-re-starting-a-research-project-where-do-you-begin" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This post is intended for anyone starting out in research and development with a computational bent, whether in a science (e.g. computational biology) or engineering context. In particular, it is focussed on the research process that leads to new tools and analysis methods.</p>
<p>So far, your exposure to knowledge discovery has likely been limited to textbook descriptions of how “thing x” was discovered. While being a consumer of such knowledge discovery is often challenging, the account you read is a highly distilled version of what happened. Being the original discoverer is more complicated.</p>
<p>Take heart! Discoveries are not arrived at in completed form. By employing a systematic approach, we incrementally assemble the pieces to draw that new insight and develop something new and valuable. What follows is a sketch of my process.</p>
</section>
<section id="structure-is-key">
<h2>Structure is key<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-is-key" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I break the process into three questions you must answer: <em>Why</em>, <em>What</em> and <em>How</em>. These correspond to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Why</em> is there a problem?</p></li>
<li><p><em>What</em> is the problem?</p></li>
<li><p><em>How</em>  will you solve it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But before we delve into those, you need to answer two other questions. What form does your final output need to be? When is that due??? If you perform research and make a brilliant discovery but don’t write a systematic description of how you made that discovery, it is the same as not doing anything.</p>
<p>Establish what form your <strong>final</strong> output should be in (talk to your supervisor). Your project plan should be something that directly references that and makes delivering it easy.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-why">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>The Why<a class="headerlink" href="#the-why" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>Why does the problem even exist? Why is it a problem worthy of your attention? Why hasn’t it already been solved? Answering all these is your justification for doing the work and, at the very least, should make you comfortable you may be doing something worthwhile.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the big picture part of the project and should proceed everything else. Identifying the existence of a problem requires you have a solid understanding of the domain. At this stage in your career, it’s quite likely that you have been “given” the problem. But once you take it, it becomes <strong>your</strong> problem <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id11" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>. In other words, the onus is on you to understand the background material that led to defining the problem. Ultimately, this requires reading about what others have done.</p>
<section id="what-are-the-existing-solutions-and-why-are-those-inadequate">
<h3>What are the existing solutions, and why are those inadequate?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-existing-solutions-and-why-are-those-inadequate" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>When you examine existing solutions, take a big picture view. What are the core algorithms they implement? How do the algorithms relate to each other? What are their inputs and outputs? Do they have a killer flaw or are they blocking a key opportunity?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Establishing <a class="reference internal" href="#the-why"><span class="std std-ref">The Why</span></a> almost always requires in-depth of consideration of what others have already done. So what are the existing solutions, and why are they not good enough? Study them carefully to look for a new investigation avenue and frame your response to <a class="reference internal" href="#the-what"><span class="std std-ref">The What</span></a>. Pay particular attention to how prior work was done, as that defines a minimum standard you must meet to have your work taken seriously.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Criticising the work of others is a “core business” in science and engineering. That said, consider these three crucial qualifiers when you frame that criticism.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>What is the <strong>evidence</strong> the solutions are inadequate? (That evidence can be measurement, or a theoretical property.)</p></li>
<li><p>The prior work was likely developed against different technological inputs <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id12" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Much of the information available to us now may not have been known to the authors of the original work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A critique of the work of others is based on what we know now. So be respectful. I guarantee you that someone will be casting their critical eye over what you do in the future.</p>
</div>

Critically, the statement must be something you can actually solve.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the nitty-gritty and why you’re reading this. It is your statement of what YOU will achieve and stems from the careful consideration described above. The framing of “what” problem you will solve can benefit from identifying both its inputs and outputs. Meaning, what is the input data (including where the data will, or can, come from)? What is the output you will produce?</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Together, the inputs and outputs define your target audience.</p>

<div><p>What is the value <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id14" id="id6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> of your proposed solution? To establish this value, be clear on the output of your work and why it will be more valuable than what exists. Will it improve prediction accuracy? Will it require magnitudes less computing resources? Will it be more maintainable?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Your answer should reflect the significance you have attributed to the shortcomings of existing approaches and your argument of the benefit to the target audience.</p>
<p>But that thinking is contingent upon the successful completion of the project. The value of a project also comes from what can be learned <em>if it fails</em>. Prepare yourself for the possibility that your proposal will not deliver on this promised value.</p>
<p>Here’s a crucial reality-check – is a negative answer still interesting <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id15" id="id7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>?</p>
<p>At the very least, you do not want the project to fail because you did not ensure the <a class="reference internal" href="#correctness"><span class="std std-ref">correctness</span></a> of your implementation or execution.</p>

<p>Your project plan begins by addressing the issues listed above. Convert those responses into a flowchart where the nodes are “processes” in your research project (e.g. data sampling). This flow chart will be a dynamic figure, meaning that you will update and refine it as you go. It is also a figure that you will likely employ when you explain the project to an audience, either in a conference presentation or a research / technical paper.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>If you can break a project into components, what is the dependency structure among them? Put the most difficult ones as close to the beginning of a project execution plan as possible.</p>
<p>It requires some significant mental effort to see how you can break a problem down into parts that can be solved independently – having done that, which is most central to your goal? Tackling that must be a priority.</p>

<p>What if your work does not “outperform” competitors? Is knowing this still valuable? There’s a strong urge to try “just one more thing” in this situation.

<p>Too often, junior researchers / engineers think they need to solve the entirety of a project by themselves … in one massive go. Don’t do that!</p>
<p>Science and engineering deliver consistently better results when multiple brains are involved. Discussions with others help you develop your understanding and provide a crucial perspective that can help you decide when you may be wasting your time pursuing an approach that cannot work or when a superior approach is possible. Your supervisor provides a crucial point of contact for such discussions. In my view, however, they should not be the only person you discuss things with.</p>

<p>An essential skill is knowing what <em>you</em> don’t know and being able to identify someone else with the necessary knowledge. That said, another critical skill is trying to solve a problem yourself before you ask someone else for help. Prior to asking someone else for help, answer the following questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Have you seriously tried?</p></li>
<li><p>What steps have you taken that you can show to the person you’re about to ask?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s in it for them? In other words, why should they spend their time helping you solve <strong>your</strong> problem?</p></li>

<p>Often, just discussing the problem with someone else is sufficient for you to identify the solution.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
